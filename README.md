# alarm-clock
A simulation of a basic alarm clock in Python

# USAGE
Run from command prompt
The program takes 2 command line arguments separated by a space:
1.	Value of minutes
2.	Value of seconds
Both must be an integer value greater than or equal to zero
A prompt then asks the user how many times does he want to ring the alarm bell.

# How to run: python file_name.py minutes_value seconds_value
E.g. python alarm.py 2 10 â€“ Sets an alarm for 2 minutes & 10 seconds from the current time
